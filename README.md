I wanted to use React to make a website portfolio that better captures some of my projects so far. The site also hosts my Resume and houses a contact form that will be built out further in the future. I deployed on Netlify below.

## Credits <a name = "credits"></a>
I had a tutoring session with Jacob Carver on 03/02/2024. Jacob helped me to get the Project component working within my Portfolio page as well as help me to set up my resume as downloadable. Thank you, Jacob!

I consulted XLA for useState help with the Contact page's error handling. It also nudged me in the direction of the onBlur handling for clicking out of the input fields.
